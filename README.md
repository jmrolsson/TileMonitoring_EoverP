# TileMonitoring_EoverP
The E/p observable measures the calorimeter response to single isolated hadrons, which is important for validation of hadronic showers, and for determining the jet energy scale uncertainty. It is constructed from the sum of calorimeter clusters or cells (E), matched to isolated inner detector tracks (p), in a cone of dR < 0.2.

NB: This repository only contains additions I made to the [TileCalorimeter/TileMonitoring package](https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/atlasoff/browser/TileCalorimeter/TileMonitoring/trunk). For the full monitoring package, including my E/p additions, you want to go here (ATLAS internal only): https://gitlab.cern.ch/jolsson/TileMonitoring

Documentation for how to run the E/p monitoring tool lives here: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/Atlas/TileEoverPMonTool
